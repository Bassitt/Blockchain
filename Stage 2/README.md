<b>Examples</b>

The example below shows how your output might look. Output information about a few first blocks of the blockchain. Also, output the time that was needed to create a block. Your results and time measurements can be totally different than in the example! To be tested successfully, the program should output information about the first three blocks of the blockchain. Blocks should be separated by an empty line
